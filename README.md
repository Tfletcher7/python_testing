# Testing oop_loan_pmt.py

This project is a part of an assignment where we need to write tests to check each function in oop_loan_pmt.py using pytest and pytest-cov. The tests should be separated by unit and functional tests and should be verbose. The given test data includes loan amount, years, interest, and monthly payment.

## Test Data
- Loan amount: 100000
- Years: 30
- Interest: 0.06
- Monthly payment: 599.55

## Steps
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install pytest and pytest-cov using the following commands:
    ```
    pip install pytest
    pip install pytest-cov
    ```
3. Open the terminal and navigate to the cloned repository's directory.
4. To run the tests, execute the following command:
    ```
    pytest --cov=./
    ```
    This command will run all the tests and provide the coverage report.
5. You can view the coverage report by opening the index.html file in the htmlcov directory generated by the above command.
6. Upload a pdf of your terminal window screenshot(s) showing all tests passed and showing >70% test coverage for the Python program.
7. Upload your GitHub repository so the test files and the original Python file can be viewed.

## Deliverables
- A pdf of your terminal window screenshot(s) showing all tests passed and showing >70% test coverage for the Python program.
- Your GitHub repository containing the test files and the original Python file.
